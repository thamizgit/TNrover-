    <p>\r\n                A tourist attraction is a place of interest that tourists visit,\r\n                typically for its inherent or an exhibited natural or cultural\r\n                value, historical significance, natural or built beauty,\r\n                offering leisure and amusement.Places of natural beauty such as\r\n                beaches, tropical island resorts, national parks, mountains,\r\n                deserts and forests, are examples of traditional tourist\r\n                attractions which people may visit. Cultural tourist attractions\r\n                can include historical places, sites of significant historic\r\n                event, monuments, ancient temples, zoos, aquaria, museums and\r\n                art galleries, botanical gardens, buildings and structures (such\r\n                as forts, castles, libraries, former prisons, skyscrapers,\r\n                bridges), theme parks and carnivals, living history museums,\r\n                public art (sculptures, statues, murals), ethnic enclave\r\n                communities, historic trains and cultural events. Factory tours,\r\n                industrial heritage, creative art and crafts workshops are the\r\n                object of cultural niches like industrial tourism and creative\r\n                tourism. Many tourist attractions are also landmarks.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </Col>\r\n        </Row>\r\n\r\n        <Row>\r\n          <Col xs={8} md={8} className=\"zooml\">\r\n            <div style={{ paddingTop: \"50px\" }} className=\"brd\">\r\n              <h2>Hospitals</h2>\r\n              <p>\r\n                A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching\r\n                to health science students and auxiliary healthcare students.

Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some\r\n                have chronic treatment units. Common support units include a\r\n                pharmacy, pathology, and radiology.

The performers may communicate\r\n                this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture,\r\n                speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted\r\n                scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the\r\n                physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The\r\n                specific place of the performance is also named by the word\r\n                \"theatre\" as derived from the Ancient Greek θέατρον . Modern\r\n                Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the theatre of\r\n                ancient Greece, from which it borrows technical terminology,\r\n                classification into genres, and many of its themes, stock\r\n                characters, and plot elements. Theatre artist Patrice Pavis\r\n                defines theatricality, theatrical language, stage writing and\r\n                the specificity of theatre as synonymous expressions that\r\n                differentiate theatre from the other performing arts, literature\r\n                and the arts in general. Modern theatre includes performances of\r\n                plays and musical theatre. The art forms of ballet and opera are\r\n                also theatre and use many conventions such as acting, costumes\r\n                and staging. They were influential to the development of musical\r\n                theatre.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </Col>\r\n        </Row>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h5
