A\n                health science facility smaller than a hospital is generally\n                called a clinic.

The performers may communicate\n                this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture,\n                speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted\n                scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the\n                physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The\n                specific place of the performance is also named by the word\n                \"theatre\" as derived from the Ancient Greek θέατρον . Modern\n                Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the theatre of\n                ancient Greece, from which it borrows technical terminology,\n                classification into genres, and many of its themes, stock\n                characters, and plot elements. Theatre artist Patrice Pavis\n                defines theatricality, theatrical language, stage writing and\n                the specificity of theatre as synonymous expressions that\n                differentiate theatre from the other performing arts, literature\n                and the arts in general. Modern theatre includes performances of\n                plays and musical theatre. The art forms of ballet and opera are\n                also theatre and use many conventions such as acting, costumes\n                and staging. They were influential to the development of musical\n                theatre.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n        <br />\n        <h5
